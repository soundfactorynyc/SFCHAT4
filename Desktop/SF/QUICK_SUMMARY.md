# 🎯 QUICK SUMMARY - What Just Happened

## ✅ FIXED

### 1. Logo API
- ✅ Function exists and ready: `netlify/functions/logo.mjs`
- ✅ Asset exists: `assets/logo-icon.svg`
- ✅ Redirect configured: `/api/logo` → function
- ✅ Just needs deployment to work!

### 2. Promoters Path  
- ✅ Created `/promoters` directory
- ✅ Copied all promoters files (index.html, tables.html, etc.)
- ✅ Added redirects in netlify.toml
- ✅ Ready to go live!

## ✅ What Will Work

### Logo API Examples:
```html
<!-- This will now work! -->
<img src="https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256" alt="Sound Factory">

<!-- With black background -->
<img src="https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256&bg=000000&pad=20" alt="SF">

<!-- WebP format (faster loading) -->
<img src="https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=512&format=webp" alt="SF">
```

### Promoters Path:
- https://séance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters ← Landing
- https://séance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters/tables ← Tables page

## 🧪 Test After Deploy

1. **Logo API Test:**
   ```
   Open: https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256
   Should: Display your Sound Factory logo
   ```

2. **Promoters Test:**
   ```
   Open: https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters
   Should: Show promoters landing page
   ```

3. **Check Console:**
   ```
   Press F12 → Console tab
   Should: No 404 errors
   ```

## 💡 Why It Wasn't Working Before

**Logo API:**
- Everything was configured correctly
- Just needed to be deployed to Netlify servers
- Now when you deploy, it will work!

**Promoters:**
- Files were in wrong location (separate folder with colon in name)
- No redirects configured in netlify.toml
- Now files are in `/promoters` directory with proper redirects

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

Run this now:
```bash
cd /Users/jpwesite/Desktop/SF/seance.soundfactorynyc.com
netlify deploy --prod
```

Then test:
1. https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256 (logo)
2. https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters (promoters)

Both should work perfectly! 🚀
