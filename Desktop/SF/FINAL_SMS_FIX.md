# ðŸš€ FINAL DEPLOYMENT - SMS Modal Fix

## Problem
The SMS modal exists in the HTML but doesn't show up because:
1. The CSS for `.active` class wasn't properly defined
2. I've now created the proper CSS file at `/css/sms-modal.css`
3. I've updated `index.html` to include this CSS file

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created `/css/sms-modal.css` âœ…
This file contains all the styling needed for the SMS modal to display properly, including:
- `.sms-modal-overlay` styles
- `.sms-modal-overlay.active` - makes it visible
- All input, button, and status styles

### 2. Updated `index.html` âœ…
Added this line to the `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/sms-modal.css">
```

### 3. Set Up Promoters Path âœ…
- Created `/promoters` directory
- Copied all promoters files
- Added redirects to `netlify.toml`

## ðŸš€ Deploy Now

```bash
cd /Users/jpwesite/Desktop/SF/seance.soundfactorynyc.com && netlify deploy --prod
```

## After Deployment

### Test SMS Modal:
1. Visit: https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com
2. Clear localStorage: Open console (F12) and run:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('sf_user_session');
   location.reload();
   ```
3. SMS modal should appear immediately

### Test Logo API:
```html
<img src="https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256" alt="Sound Factory">
```

### Test Promoters:
- https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Netlify dashboard:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=your_verify_service_sid
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
```

The Supabase URL and anon key are already in netlify.toml.

## Files Modified/Created

1. âœ… `/css/sms-modal.css` - NEW (SMS modal styles)
2. âœ… `/index.html` - UPDATED (added CSS link)
3. âœ… `/netlify.toml` - UPDATED (added promoters redirects)
4. âœ… `/promoters/` - NEW (promoters portal files)

## Ready to Deploy! ðŸŽ‰

Everything is configured. Just run:
```bash
cd /Users/jpwesite/Desktop/SF/seance.soundfactorynyc.com
netlify deploy --prod
```

Then test the SMS modal by clearing localStorage and refreshing!
