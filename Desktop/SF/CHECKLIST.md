## 📊 Quick Status Check

Run these in browser console (F12):

```javascript
// Should load logo image
fetch('https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256')
  .then(r => console.log('Logo API:', r.status === 200 ? '✅ Working' : '❌ Error'))
  .catch(e => console.log('Logo API: ❌ Error', e));

// Should load promoters page
fetch('https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters')
  .then(r => console.log('Promoters:', r.status === 200 ? '✅ Working' : '❌ Error'))
  .catch(e => console.log('Promoters: ❌ Error', e));
```

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You'll know everything works when:

1. ✅ Logo displays in browser: `https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256`
2. ✅ Promoters page loads: `https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/promoters`
3. ✅ No 404 errors in browser console
4. ✅ This works in HTML: `<img src="https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/api/logo?size=256">`

## 🔧 If Something Doesn't Work

### Logo API returns 404:
1. Check Netlify function logs in dashboard
2. Verify asset file deployed: Check Netlify deploy log for `assets/logo-icon.svg`
3. Try direct function URL: `https://seance.soundfactorynyc.com/.netlify/functions/logo?size=256`

### Promoters returns 404:
1. Check if files deployed: Look for `promoters/` folder in Netlify deploy log
2. Verify redirect order in netlify.toml (should be BEFORE `/*` catch-all)
3. Test other promoters URLs: `/promoters/tables`, `/promoters/promoter-dashboard`

### Main site breaks:
1. Check for syntax errors in netlify.toml
2. Look for redirect conflicts
3. Review Netlify build log for errors

---

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **netlify.toml** - Added promoters redirects
2. **Created:** `/promoters/` directory with all files

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Deploy** (run the command above)
2. **Test** (check all 5 URLs above)
3. **Update** your site to use the logo API where needed
4. **Enjoy** having both logo API and promoters path working! 🎉
