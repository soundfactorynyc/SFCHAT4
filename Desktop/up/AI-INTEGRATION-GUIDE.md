# Sound Factory AI Components Integration Guide

## ðŸŽµ AI Audio Sampler & ðŸŽ¤ AI Vocal Studio

### **Components Created:**

1. **AI Audio Sampler** (`ai-audio-sampler.html`)
   - 20-second audio clip recording
   - Real-time waveform visualization
   - 1/2/4/8 bar loop creation
   - Beat/tempo matching
   - Sample library management
   - Modal AI processing integration

2. **AI Vocal Studio** (`ai-vocal-studio.html`)
   - Up to 5-minute vocal recording
   - Auto-tune with correction speed control
   - Key detection (A MIN, C MAJ, etc.)
   - BPM detection (120-160)
   - Harmony generation & double tracking
   - Sample pad triggers (YEAH, UH, WHAT, GO)
   - Effects chain (Reverb, Delay, Chorus, Distortion, Compressor, Filter)
   - Legal agreement modal
   - 48kHz/24-bit audio specs
   - 5.8ms processing latency

3. **Modal Backend Service** (`ai_sampler_service.py`)
   - AI audio processing endpoint
   - Beat matching and tempo adjustment
   - Harmonic content generation
   - AI effects application
   - CORS headers configured
   - Health check endpoint

### **Integration Features:**

âœ… **Navigation Links Added**
- Added to main site header: "ðŸŽµ AI Sampler" and "ðŸŽ¤ AI Studio"
- Styled with teal gradient to match Sound Factory theme
- Mobile responsive design

âœ… **Authentication Required**
- SMS login verification for both AI tools
- Redirects to main site if not authenticated
- Uses existing Sound Factory auth system

âœ… **iOS Compatibility**
- PWA meta tags for full-screen experience
- Viewport height fixes for iOS Safari
- Touch optimizations and orientation handling
- Device motion/orientation permission requests

âœ… **Modal Integration**
- Endpoint: `https://sf-ai-audio-sampler.modal.run/process`
- CORS headers configured for web integration
- Fallback processing if Modal endpoint unavailable

### **Deployment Instructions:**

#### **1. Deploy Modal Service:**
```bash
# Install Modal CLI
pip install modal

# Deploy the AI service
modal deploy ai_sampler_service.py
```

#### **2. Update Netlify Configuration:**
Add to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/ai-sampler"
  to = "/ai-audio-sampler.html"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/ai-studio"
  to = "/ai-vocal-studio.html"
  status = 200
```

#### **3. Environment Variables:**
No additional environment variables needed - uses existing Sound Factory auth system.
