## 🔧 NEXT STEPS TO FIX SMS

### Step 1: Verify Twilio Account
1. Log into Twilio Console: https://console.twilio.com
2. Check account status - make sure it's active
3. Check balance - make sure you have credits

### Step 2: Verify the Verify Service Exists
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/verify/services
2. Look for service with SID: `VAd6f067a14593f46ba9b6cf80cb50f7a1`
3. Make sure it's **enabled** and **active**
4. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to create a new one

### Step 3: Test Credentials
Run this command to test if credentials work:
```bash
cd /Users/jpwesite/Desktop/promo/3promoters-new
node test-sms-live.js
```

### Step 4: If Service Doesn't Exist - Create New One
If the Verify service is missing, create a new one:
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/verify/services
2. Click "Create new"
3. Give it a name: "Sound Factory Promoters"
4. Copy the new Service SID
5. Update in Netlify:
```bash
netlify env:set TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID "VA_YOUR_NEW_SID"
netlify deploy --prod
