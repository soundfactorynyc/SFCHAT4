# 🎯 FINAL DIAGNOSIS - "Promoter not found" Error

## TL;DR - The Issue

**SMS login works ✅**  
**Dashboard fails ❌**

**Why?** → **No promoter in database for your phone number**

---

## The 2-Minute Fix

### What You Need to Do:

**Add your phone number to the Supabase database!**

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run this (with YOUR phone number):

```sql
INSERT INTO promoters (
  promo_code, name, email, phone, status
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_CODE', 'Your Name', 'your@email.com', '+1XXXXXXXXXX', 'approved'
)
ON CONFLICT (phone) DO UPDATE SET status = 'approved';
```

3. Try login again → Should work! ✅

---

## What's Actually Happening

### The Login Flow:

```
1. User enters phone number
   ↓
2. SMS code sent (Twilio) ✅ WORKS
   ↓
3. User enters code
   ↓
4. verify-sms-code.js checks database for promoter with that phone
   ↓
   ❌ NO PROMOTER FOUND → "Promoter not found" error
   ✅ PROMOTER FOUND → Returns promo code, redirects to dashboard
   ↓
5. Dashboard loads with promo code ✅
```

**You're stuck at step 4** because there's no promoter in the database!

## Why All The Code is Correct

I fixed these files:
- ✅ `verify-sms-code.js` - Returns correct fields
- ✅ `get-promoter.js` - Queries Supabase correctly
- ✅ `promoter-login.html` - Handles response correctly
- ✅ `promoter-dashboard.html` - Calls API correctly

**All the code works!** It just needs a promoter to find.

---

## Quick Test

### Check if promoter exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM promoters WHERE phone = '+1XXXXXXXXXX';
```

**If empty** → That's your problem!  
**If has data** → Check status is 'approved'

## Example SQL (Replace with Your Info)

```sql
-- Example: Add John Doe with phone +19293629534
INSERT INTO promoters (
  promo_code,
  name,
  email,
  phone,
  status,
  tickets_sold,
  commission_earned
) VALUES (
  'JOHN2025',                -- Your promo code
  'John Doe',                -- Your name
  'john@example.com',        -- Your email
  '+19293629534',            -- YOUR PHONE (E.164 format!)
  'approved',                -- Must be 'approved'
  0,
  0
);
```

## After Adding Promoter

Test the flow:
1. ✅ Go to login page
2. ✅ Enter your phone number
3. ✅ Get SMS code
4. ✅ Enter code
5. ✅ **Dashboard loads!** 🎉
