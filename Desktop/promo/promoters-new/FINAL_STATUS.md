## 💰 COMMISSION TRACKING - PERFECT ✅

### How Promoters Get Paid

**Your system tracks EVERYTHING automatically:**

**Tickets: $10 per ticket**
```
Customer buys ticket → $10 credited to promoter instantly
10 tickets = $100
50 tickets = $500
100 tickets = $1,000
```

**Tables: 20% of table price**
```
2-person table ($400) → $80 commission
4-person table ($800) → $160 commission
6-person table ($1,200) → $240 commission
8-person table ($1,600) → $320 commission
10-person table ($2,000) → $400 commission
12-person table ($2,400) → $480 commission
```

**Database Tracking:**
- ✅ Every sale recorded in `promoter_sales` table

## ⚡ WHAT I FIXED FOR YOU

### 1. Commission Display Bug ✅ FIXED

**Before:**
```javascript
// Divided by 100 incorrectly (showing cents as dollars)
'$' + ((promoter.commission_earned || 0) / 100).toFixed(2)
// If earned $100, would show "$1.00" ❌
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Now shows correct dollar amount
'$' + (Number(promoter.commission_earned) || 0).toFixed(2)
// If earned $100, shows "$100.00" ✅
```

**Impact:** Promoters will now see accurate earnings

## 🚨 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (15 Minutes)

### Critical Task #1: Set Up Webhook Secret (5 min)

**Why This Matters:**
Without this, promoters DON'T get credited for sales. This is the #1 most important setup step.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. URL: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. Events: `checkout.session.completed` + `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Copy the signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Add to `.env`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
7. Add to Netlify: Site Settings → Environment variables

**Detailed Guide:** See `WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

---

### Recommended Task #2: Clean Up Test Keys (2 min)

**Current `.env` has duplicate keys:**
```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_live_..." ✅ Keep this
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..." ❌ Remove this
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..." ✅ Keep this
```

**Action:**
Remove or comment out the test publishable key to avoid confusion.

---

### Task #3: Test Everything (8 min)

**Complete Test Flow:**

1. **Create test promoter** (2 min)
   - Fill signup form
   - Connect Stripe (use test mode for this)
   - Get promo code

2. **Make test purchase** (2 min)
   - Use promoter's link
   - Test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Complete checkout

3. **Verify webhook** (2 min)
   - Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
   - Check "Recent deliveries"
   - Should show ✅ "Succeeded"

4. **Check commission** (2 min)
   - Log in as promoter
   - Verify dashboard shows:
     * 1 ticket sold
     * $10.00 earned
   - Check database:
     * `promoters` table updated
     * `promoter_sales` record created
