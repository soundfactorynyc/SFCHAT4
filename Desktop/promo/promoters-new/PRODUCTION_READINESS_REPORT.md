## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES - Must Fix Before Launch

### üö® ISSUE #1: Missing Webhook Secret (BLOCKS PRODUCTION)

**Problem:** Webhook won't work without this secret
**Location:** `.env` file
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT SET

**What this means:**
- Stripe sends payment notifications to your site
- Without the secret, your site can't verify the notification is real
- **Result: Promoters WON'T get credited for sales**

**How to Fix (5 minutes):**

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter URL: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Click "Add endpoint"
6. Copy the "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_`)
7. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
   ```
8. Also add to Netlify: Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

**Test it works:**
- Make a test purchase
- Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Events
- Verify webhook shows "Succeeded"

### üö® ISSUE #2: Commission Display Bug

**Problem:** Commission shown in cents, not dollars
**Location:** `public/test-sms-login.html` line 286
**Current Code:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('commission').textContent = '$' + ((promoter.commission_earned || 0) / 100).toFixed(2);
```

**Issue:** Database stores dollars (not cents), so dividing by 100 is wrong

**Example of bug:**
- Promoter earns $100
- Dashboard shows: "$1.00" ‚ùå

**How to Fix:**
Replace line 286-287 with:
```javascript
document.getElementById('ticketsSold').textContent = promoter.tickets_sold || 0;
document.getElementById('commission').textContent = '$' + (Number(promoter.commission_earned) || 0).toFixed(2);
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE #3: Test Mode Keys Still Present

**Problem:** `.env` has both test and live keys
**Risk:** Confusion about which mode is active

**Current in `.env`:**
```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_live_51PY93aKgJ6MFAw17..." ‚úÖ GOOD
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_51PY93aKgJ6MFAw17..." ‚ùå REMOVE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_51PY93aKgJ6MFAw17..." ‚úÖ GOOD
```

**How to Fix:**
1. Remove or comment out all test keys
2. Make sure only LIVE keys are active
3. Double-check Netlify environment variables match

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS (Not Critical)
### 1. Enhanced Trust & Professionalism

**Add Trust Elements to Homepage:**
- Add "Powered by Stripe" logo

```

**Add Sales History:**

### 3. Mobile Optimization

**Current site is good, but enhance:**
