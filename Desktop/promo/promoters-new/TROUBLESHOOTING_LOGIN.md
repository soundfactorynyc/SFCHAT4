# üîç TROUBLESHOOTING: "No Account Found" Error

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Your Account EXISTS

I checked the database and found:
```
Name: Jonathan Peters
Phone: +19293629534
Promo Code: JP2025
Status: approved ‚úÖ
```

## ‚ùå PROBLEM: SMS Login Can't Find You

When you try to login at https://team.soundfactorynyc.com/promoter-login.html, it says "No account found."

## üîç POSSIBLE CAUSES:

### 1. Environment Variables Not Loading
The Netlify functions might not have access to SUPABASE credentials.

**Check:**
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/teamsf/settings/deploys#environment-variables
- Verify these are set:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 2. Phone Number Format Mismatch
The function might be searching for a different phone format.

**Your DB has:** `+19293629534`  
**You're entering:** ?

### 3. Function Not Deployed Properly
The send-sms-code function might have an error.

## üîß QUICK FIX - TEST LOCALLY:

Since we can't test the live site easily, let's test the function locally:

```bash
cd /Users/jpwesite/Desktop/promo/promoters-new

# Start Netlify dev server
netlify dev
```

Then in your browser:
1. Go to: http://localhost:8888/promoter-login.html
2. Try logging in with: +19293629534
3. Check if SMS arrives

## üîç ALTERNATIVE: Check Function Logs

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/teamsf/logs/functions
2. Look for recent `send-sms-code` calls
3. Check what error it's showing

## üéØ MOST LIKELY ISSUE:

The Supabase environment variables might not be set correctly in Netlify. Let me verify them now...
