# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIXES REQUIRED
## Site: team.soundfactorynyc.com (Netlify)
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

---

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Stripe API Keys
**Issue:** Mixed test/live keys causing payment failures  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED IN LOCAL .env FILE**

**What I Changed:**
- Switched to LIVE publishable key: `[STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY]...`
- Kept LIVE secret key: `[STRIPE_SECRET_KEY]...`
- Commented out test keys for future reference

**What You Need to Do:**
This is already fixed in your local `.env` file, but you MUST update Netlify environment variables!

---

## üö® CRITICAL TASKS (Must Complete Before Site Works)

### 1. UPDATE NETLIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (10 minutes)

**Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Log in to https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your "team.soundfactorynyc.com" site
3. Go to: Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

**Update These Variables:**
```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = [STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY]

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = [STRIPE_SECRET_KEY]
```

**Remove or Update:**
- Delete `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` if it exists (duplicate of STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY)
- Make sure NO test keys are in Netlify environment

---

### 2. CONFIGURE STRIPE WEBHOOK (15 minutes)

**Current Problem:**
Your webhook secret `whsec_9Cp1dvXttlkPrIE7ZbHkC2oygFYMgdMK` may be outdated or incorrect.

**Steps to Fix:**

**A. Go to Stripe Dashboard**
https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

**B. Check Existing Endpoints**
Look for: `https://team.soundfactorynyc.com/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`

**C. If Endpoint Exists:**
1. Click on it
2. Click "Reveal" under "Signing secret"
3. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)
4. Compare to your current `.env` value
5. If different, update both:
   - Local `.env` file
   - Netlify environment variables

**D. If Endpoint Does NOT Exist:**
1. Click "+ Add endpoint"
2. Enter endpoint URL: `https://team.soundfactorynyc.com/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
3. Select events to listen to:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed` (REQUIRED)
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded` (REQUIRED)
4. Click "Add endpoint"
5. Copy the "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Update:
   - Local `.env`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
   - Netlify environment: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

**E. Verify Webhook is Working:**
After deployment, go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint
- Should show "‚úÖ Succeeded" for recent events
- If showing errors, check the error details

---

### 3. VERIFY OTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

**Check These Are Set in Netlify:**
```
‚úÖ SUPABASE_URL = https://axhsljfsrfkrpdtbgdpv.supabase.co
‚úÖ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
‚úÖ TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = AC0b07f1131359606c90cb23e3d0eaca75
‚úÖ TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 85a38b02f4af3354c7aa667ac8fde26a
‚úÖ TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID = VAd6f067a14593f46ba9b6cf80cb50f7a1
‚úÖ ADMIN_USERNAME = admin
‚úÖ ADMIN_PASSWORD = Deepernyc1
‚úÖ JWT_SECRET = 21525582387980951870456101696329
```

**Optional but Recommended:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for AI flyer assistant)
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN (for Facebook posting)
SENDGRID_API_KEY (for email notifications)
```

---

### 4. DEPLOY TO NETLIFY (5 minutes)

**Option A: Using Netlify CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/jpwesite/Desktop/promo/promoters-new
netlify deploy --prod
```
