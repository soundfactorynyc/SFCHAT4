## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: VERIFY STRIPE WEBHOOK

### Steps to Verify:

2. Find endpoint: `https://team.soundfactorynyc.com/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
3. Check if it exists:
   - **If YES:** Click "Reveal" and verify secret matches `whsec_9Cp1dv...`
   - **If NO:** Create new endpoint (see instructions below)

### If Webhook Doesn't Exist - Create It:
1. Click "+ Add endpoint"
2. Endpoint URL: `https://team.soundfactorynyc.com/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
3. Description: "Team SF Promoter Commissions"
4. Events to send:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Click "Add endpoint"
6. Copy the signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)
7. If different from current, update:
   ```bash
   netlify env:set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET "whsec_YOUR_NEW_SECRET"
